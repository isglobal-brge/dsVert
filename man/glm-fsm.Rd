\title{GLM Phase-Ordering FSM Firewall}
\description{
Server-side finite state machine that prevents protocol abuse
in the GLM secure aggregation protocol. Each server tracks its own
session state and rejects out-of-order or replayed operations.
}
\details{
The FSM enforces the following phase ordering on the coordinator:
\preformatted{
INIT -> EXPECT_ETAS -> COORD_READY -> COORD_DONE ->
  BLOCKS_ACTIVE -> EXPECT_ETAS (next iter) -> ... -> TERMINATED
}

Key enforcement rules:
\itemize{
\item Coordinator MUST receive exactly \code{n_nonlabel} etas before stepping
\item Iteration numbers MUST be strictly increasing (anti-replay)
\item Session IDs must match on every call
}
}
