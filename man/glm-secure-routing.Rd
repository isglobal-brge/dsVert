\title{GLM Secure Routing - Server-Side Functions}
\description{
Server-side functions for the GLM Secure Routing protocol.
These ensure that individual-level vectors (eta, mu, w, v) are never
visible to the client. The client acts as a blind relay, passing
transport-encrypted blobs between the coordinator (label server) and
non-label servers.
}
\details{
In the standard GLM protocol, the client computes and broadcasts
n-length vectors (eta_total, mu, w, v) at each BCD iteration. This is
disclosive because eta = X*beta can reveal individual-level features
(DataSHIELD blocks linear predictor disclosure in dsBase's ds.glm).

The Secure Routing protocol replaces this with end-to-end encrypted
transport between servers:
\enumerate{
\item The label server acts as \strong{coordinator}: it receives
encrypted etas from non-label servers, decrypts them, runs IRLS,
and encrypts (mu, w, v) under each non-label server's transport PK.
\item Non-label servers decrypt their (mu, w, v) blob locally, compute
encrypted gradients, and after threshold decryption + BCD solve,
encrypt their new eta under the coordinator's transport PK.
\item The client only sees: betas (p_k-length coefficient vectors,
safe aggregate statistics) and opaque encrypted blobs.
}
}
