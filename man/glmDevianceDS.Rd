\title{Calculate GLM Deviance Component (Server-Side)}
\usage{
glmDevianceDS(data_name, y_name, eta, family = "gaussian")
}
\arguments{
\item{data_name}{Character string. Name of the data frame containing
the response variable in the server environment.}

\item{y_name}{Character string. Name of the response variable.}

\item{eta}{Numeric vector. Total linear predictor (sum of all partitions).}

\item{family}{Character string. GLM family: "gaussian", "binomial",
or "poisson". Default is "gaussian".}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{deviance}: Total deviance contribution
\item \code{null_deviance}: Null model deviance (intercept only)
\item \code{n_obs}: Number of observations
}
}
\description{
Server-side aggregate function that calculates the deviance
contribution from this partition for a fitted GLM. Used for model
evaluation in vertically partitioned data.
}
\details{
The deviance is calculated as twice the difference between the saturated
model log-likelihood and the fitted model log-likelihood.

Deviance formulas by family:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Gaussian}: \eqn{\sum (y - \mu)^2}
\item \strong{Binomial}: \eqn{2 \sum [y \log(y/\mu) + (1-y) \log((1-y)/(1-\mu))]}
\item \strong{Poisson}: \eqn{2 \sum [y \log(y/\mu) - (y - \mu)]}
}

Privacy is preserved because only aggregate deviance values are returned,
not individual residuals.
