\title{Local Correlation (Server-Side)}
\usage{
localCorDS(data_name, variables)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_name}{Character string. Name of the data frame in the server environment.}

\item{variables}{Character vector. Names of numeric columns to include.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{correlation}: The correlation matrix (p x p)
\item \code{n_obs}: Number of observations used
\item \code{var_names}: Variable names
}
}
\description{
Server-side aggregate function that computes the correlation
matrix for variables stored locally on this server.
}
\details{
This function computes the standard Pearson correlation matrix for variables
stored locally on the server. No encryption is needed because all the data
is on the same server.

This is used for the diagonal blocks of the full correlation matrix when
combining data from multiple servers.
}
\section{Privacy}{

The correlation matrix is a summary statistic that does not reveal individual
observations. However, with very few observations or extreme values, some
information about individuals could potentially be inferred.

The function enforces a minimum observation count based on the DataSHIELD
privacy level setting.
