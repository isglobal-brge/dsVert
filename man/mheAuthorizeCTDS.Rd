\title{Batch-authorize ciphertexts for decryption on this server}
\usage{
mheAuthorizeCTDS(
  ct_hashes = NULL,
  op_type = "cross-product",
  from_storage = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ct_hashes}{Character vector. SHA-256 hashes of authorized ciphertexts.
Ignored when \code{from_storage = TRUE}.}

\item{op_type}{Character. Operation type ("cross-product" or "glm-gradient")}

\item{from_storage}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, read \code{ct_hashes} from
server-side blob storage (comma-separated) instead of inline argument.
Default \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
Integer. Number of ciphertexts authorized
}
\description{
Called by the client to authorize a batch of ciphertexts for partial
decryption. The ct_hashes are SHA-256 hashes of ciphertexts produced by
a legitimate operation on another server. The client relays these hashes
(which do not reveal ciphertext content) so that this server knows which
ciphertexts are authorized for decryption.
}
\details{
This prevents the decryption oracle attack: a client cannot fabricate
arbitrary ciphertexts for decryption because the hashes must match
ciphertexts produced by actual server-side operations.
