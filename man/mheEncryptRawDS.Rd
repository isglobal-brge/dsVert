\title{Encrypt raw response variable under CPK (label server only)}
\usage{
mheEncryptRawDS(data_name, y_var)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_name}{Character. Name of data frame on the label server.}

\item{y_var}{Character. Name of the response variable column.}
}
\value{
List with:
\itemize{
\item \code{encrypted_y}: base64url-encoded CKKS ciphertext of y
\item \code{num_obs}: number of observations
}
}
\description{
Encrypts the response variable y under the Collective Public Key (CPK)
so it can be distributed to non-label servers for homomorphic gradient
computation. The encrypted y is a CKKS ciphertext that supports
addition and multiplication with plaintext vectors.
}
\details{
For Gaussian family, y is standardized before encryption (handled by
\code{glmStandardizeDS}). For non-Gaussian families, raw y values are
encrypted because the link function is nonlinear and standardization
would change the model.

Each observation is packed as a single-element row because the Go
encrypt-columns command expects row-major input. The \code{I()} wrapper
prevents \code{jsonlite::auto_unbox} from converting length-1 vectors
to JSON scalars (Go expects arrays).
