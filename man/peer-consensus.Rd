\title{Peer Manifest Consensus}
\description{
Functions for cross-validating that all servers see the same
peer set and configuration. Prevents a malicious client from telling
different servers different peer sets (phantom peer injection).
}
\details{
After transport key distribution, each server computes
\code{SHA-256(canonical_manifest_json)} and transport-encrypts its hash
to each peer. Each peer decrypts and compares. Mismatch triggers a stop.
}
