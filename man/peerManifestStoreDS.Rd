\usage{
peerManifestStoreDS(manifest_json, session_id = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{manifest_json}{Character. Canonical JSON manifest string (built by
the client using the same deterministic key-sorting as
\code{.build_manifest}).}

\item{session_id}{Character or NULL. Session identifier.}
}
\value{
Named list. Peer name -> transport-encrypted hash blob (base64url).
Each blob is encrypted under the corresponding peer's transport PK.
}
\description{
Called by the client after transport key distribution. Stores the canonical
manifest and its SHA-256 hash in session storage. Returns transport-encrypted
hashes for each peer so the client can relay them.
}
