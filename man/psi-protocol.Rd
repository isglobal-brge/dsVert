\title{ECDH-PSI Record Alignment - Server-Side Functions}
\description{
These functions implement Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Private Set
Intersection (ECDH-PSI) for privacy-preserving record alignment across vertically
partitioned data. Unlike SHA-256 hashing, ECDH-PSI ensures the client cannot
reverse-engineer patient identifiers from the exchanged messages.
}
\details{
The protocol exploits the commutativity of scalar multiplication on P-256:
\eqn{\alpha \cdot (\beta \cdot H(id)) = \beta \cdot (\alpha \cdot H(id))}.

Security holds under the DDH assumption on P-256 (semi-honest model):
\itemize{
\item The client sees only opaque elliptic curve points (not reversible)
\item Each target server learns only the intersection with the reference
\item No party can perform dictionary attacks on identifiers
}
