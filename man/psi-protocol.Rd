\title{ECDH-PSI Record Alignment - Server-Side Functions (Blind Relay)}
\description{
These functions implement Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Private Set
Intersection (ECDH-PSI) for privacy-preserving record alignment across vertically
partitioned data. All EC point exchanges are transport-encrypted (X25519 +
AES-256-GCM ECIES) so the client acts as a blind relay, never seeing raw
elliptic curve points.
}
\details{
The protocol exploits the commutativity of scalar multiplication on P-256:
\eqn{\alpha \cdot (\beta \cdot H(id)) = \beta \cdot (\alpha \cdot H(id))}.

Security (DDH assumption on P-256, malicious-client model):
\itemize{
\item The client sees only opaque encrypted blobs (not reversible)
\item Each server's scalar never leaves the server
\item The PSI firewall enforces phase ordering and one-shot semantics
\item No party can perform dictionary attacks or OPRF oracle attacks
}
